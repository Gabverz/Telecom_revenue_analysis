# Megaline Telecommunications Project - Prepaid Plan Revenue Analysis

### Problem Context:
Development of a comprehensive data analysis to determine which of two prepaid plans (Surf and Ultimate) offered by Megaline telecommunications company generates more revenue, using data from 500 customers throughout 2018.

### Objective:
Analyze customer behavior patterns and calculate total revenue generated by each plan to guide advertising budget allocation decisions and business strategy optimization.

Technical Competencies Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Investigation of 5 interconnected datasets (users, calls, messages, internet usage, plans)
- Analysis of customer demographics, usage patterns, and temporal trends
- Statistical analysis of service consumption by plan type

Data Preprocessing:
- Data type conversions (datetime formatting)
- Data aggregation and consolidation across multiple tables
- Feature engineering for monthly usage calculations
- Revenue calculation functions incorporating base fees and overage charges

Advanced Analytics:
- Customer behavior analysis by plan type (calls, messages, internet usage)
- Revenue calculation including base monthly fees and additional charges for exceeding limits
- Temporal analysis showing seasonal usage patterns
- Statistical comparison of plan performance

Statistical Hypothesis Testing:
- T-tests comparing revenue differences between plans
- Geographic analysis (NY-NJ vs other regions)
- Variance analysis and significance testing
- Statistical validation of business insights

Data Visualization:
- Bar charts showing temporal trends
- Histograms for usage distribution analysis
- Box plots for statistical distribution comparison
- Revenue comparison visualizations

### Main Libraries:
- pandas: Data manipulation, aggregation, and pivot tables
- numpy: Mathematical operations and statistical calculations
- scipy.stats: Statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests)
- matplotlib: Data visualization and plotting

### Final Results:
Comprehensive analysis revealing that the Surf plan generates significantly higher total revenue than the Ultimate plan throughout most of the year, primarily due to frequent overage charges. Key findings include:

Surf plan users frequently exceed included limits, generating substantial additional revenue
Ultimate plan provides more stable monthly revenue but lower total returns
Statistical significance confirmed through hypothesis testing (p-value < 0.01)
No significant revenue difference found between NY-NJ region and other areas
Strategic recommendations provided for short-term vs long-term business planning
The project demonstrates proficiency in end-to-end business analytics, from data preprocessing through statistical validation to actionable business insights.
